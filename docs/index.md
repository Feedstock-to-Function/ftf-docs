# Feedstock to Function Documentation

This is the home for all documentation relating to the
[Feedstock to Function Tool](https://feestock-to-function.lbl.gov) (FTF),
  a project that harnesses the power of machine learning to predict properties
  of high-potential molecules derived from biomass and evaluates the cost,
  benefits, and risk of promising biobased molecules or biofuels to enable
  faster, less expensive bioprocess optimization and scale-up.
  
The documentation on this site encompasses the following:  

* [Methodology](../methodology/property-prediction/): 
how we generate and validate our computed data sets
* [User Reference](../user-guide/rest-api/): Detailed help for using our website
 and application programming interface (API).

If you notice an error or omission, please post an [issue](
https://github.com/Feedstock-to-Function/ftf-docs/issues/new) 
or click a pencil icon
(<span class="md-icon" style="color:grey">edit</span>) on a page to suggest an
edit to us.

Thanks,
